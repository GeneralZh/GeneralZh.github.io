## Generalz Blog
## Features

The blog is based on mmistakes' contribution for [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and [Joe's blog](https://hijiangtao.github.io/). Besides, I create a new layout `keynote`, to combine nicely HTML Presentation content and your blog post.

**Usage**: a extra `iframe` is used to define the url of your HTML Presentation, the format of `keynote` layout shows below: 

```
---
date: XXXX-XX-XX
layout: keynote
title: THIS IS YOUR ARTICLE TITLE
thread: THREAD ID
categories: CATEGORY
tags: [tag1, tag2]
excerpt: Introduction
iframe: PUT YOUR URL HERE, such as https://hijiangtao.github.io/slides/s-D3-Basic-Tutorial
---
```
